          "question": "What is Shou Sugi Ban?",
          "answer": "Shou Sugi Ban is an ancient Japanese technique that involves charring wood to protect and enhance its natural beauty. This traditional method originated as a way to make wood more resistant to the elements, including insects, fire, and weathering. The process creates a striking aesthetic with deep tones, unique textures, and an elegant, rustic look."
        },
        "02": {
          "question": "How do I maintain Shou Sugi Ban wood?",
          "answer": "Shou Sugi Ban surfaces are typically low-maintenance. There’s no need for daily cleaning—an occasional gentle rinse to remove dust and dirt (as needed or seasonally) is usually enough. Avoid high-pressure washing and abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the surface texture. If the surface is oiled, refreshing the oil every ~2–5 years is typically sufficient (depending on sun exposure, rain, and facade orientation)."
        },
        "03": {
          "question": "Where can charred wood products be used?",
          "answer": "Charred wood (yakisugi) is well-suited for ventilated facades, wall and ceiling cladding, decorative partitions, fences, gates, and exterior accents. Indoors it’s often used for feature walls and furniture details—choose an appropriate finish (e.g., oil or lacquer) to reduce rub-off and make cleaning easier. For outdoor use, longevity depends heavily on correct detailing: ventilation, proper fasteners, and avoiding areas where water can sit on the surface."
        },
        "04": {
          "question": "How is Shou Sugi Ban installed?",
          "answer": "Shou Sugi Ban boards are most commonly installed as ventilated facade cladding on battens/framing, leaving an air gap to help moisture evaporate. Use stainless steel fasteners, follow the recommended expansion gaps, and install with correct water run-off detailing. It’s also a good idea to protect end-grain and cut edges (e.g., with oil/sealer, depending on the system). Before installation, store boards in a dry, ventilated area and pre-drill fastener points when needed to reduce the risk of splitting."
        },
        "05": {
          "question": "Is Shou Sugi Ban suitable for interior use?",
          "answer": "Yes—Shou Sugi Ban works well indoors for feature walls, ceilings, niches, and furniture details. For interior applications we recommend an oiled finish: when properly processed and oiled, the surface does not rub off and does not shed, and it’s easy to maintain."
        },
        "06": {
          "question": "Is Yakisugi suitable for all climates?",
          "answer": "Yakisugi performs well across many climates, but longevity depends on the wood species, charring/brushing intensity, chosen finish, and construction detailing. In humid/coastal conditions and on south-facing elevations (high UV exposure), finishes may need to be refreshed more often. The key is ventilated installation, good drainage/run-off detailing, and avoiding situations where water remains on the surface."
        },
        "07": {
          "question": "What are the standard dimensions for Shou Sugi Ban planks?",
          "answer": "Typical facade board widths are 95–145 mm, with common lengths of 3–6 m (depending on the selected profile and wood species). Exact dimensions depend on your profile choice and project requirements—custom options are also possible."

      "heroBody": "We produce wood prepared according to the unique, time-tested Japanese wood-burning technology \"Yakisugi\" (or \"Shou Sugi Ban\").

The traditional Japanese woodworking technology, which has been around for centuries, was introduced to protect wood from the effects of the environment. Burning shrinks the pores in the surface of the wood, making it stronger and more resistant. At the same time, it retains its properties, naturalness, pattern and colour.",

          "content": "No, a charred fence does not require painting. The natural charred surface is the protection itself. Protective oil can be periodically renewed, but it's not necessary. The fence naturally ages to a silver tone or remains deep black with oil."

          "title": "Can a charred fence withstand Baltic climate?",
          "content": "Yes, charred wood is particularly well suited for Baltic climate conditions. The charring process creates a hydrophobic layer that repels moisture. The fence will withstand rain, snow, cold, and heat without any problems."
